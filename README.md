<strong>Create a File Menu in your GUI</strong>

Add a file menu to your CandleGUI with options to open any file for reading (and displaying the file as in Project 2), and one to Quit the program. You will need a FileMenuHandler class to handle the events from the FileMenu.

Create a jar file called <strong>Project3.jar</strong> and submit that to Blackboard by the due date for full credit.
